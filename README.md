# Solving-N-Queens-Problem-Using-Evolutionary-Algorithmh-

This project implements an evolutionary algorithm to solve the classic N-Queens problem. By simulating the process of natural selection, the algorithm iteratively evolves a population of candidate solutions to find arrangements where no two queens threaten each other. The approach demonstrates how genetic operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation can be effectively applied to optimize solutions for combinatorial problems like N-Queens.
